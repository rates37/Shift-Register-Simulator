# Shift-Register-Simulator
An online simulator for the 74HC595 Shift Register IC

## Getting Started

To use this tool, head over to [this link](https://rates37.github.io/shift_register_simulator/).


## Road Map

- [ ] Add mouseover tooltips for each component on the board



## Why

I was bored, and thought it could be a useful teaching tool to show how the 74HC595 IC works. The design is heavily inspired by a physical PCB that was used to teach students in Monash University's ENG1013 unit.
